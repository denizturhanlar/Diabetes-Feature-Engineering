# Diabetes-Feature-Engineering


# Business Problem
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their characteristics are specified. You are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps before developing the model.

# Data-Set
This dataset is a subset of the extensive collection of data maintained by the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the United States. The data was gathered for diabetes research and pertains to Pima Indian women aged 21 and above residing in Phoenix, Arizona, the fifth-largest city in the state. The dataset includes 768 entries and eight numerical independent variables. The target variable, labeled "outcome," has two possible values: 1 indicates a positive result for diabetes, while 0 indicates a negative result.

# Columns Name  Description
- Pregnancies:	Number of pregnancies
- Glucose: Glucose
- BloodPressure: Blood pressure (Diastolic)
- SkinThickness: Skin Thickness
- Insulin: Insulin
- BMI:	Body mass index
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction:	A function that calculates our probability of having diabetes based on our descendants.
- Age:	Age (year)
- Outcome:	Information whether the person has diabetes or not. Have the disease (1) or not (0)

# Reminder
Data collection: Collect data from various sources, which could include web scraping, APIs, databases, and flat files.

Data cleaning: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, duplicates, and other data quality issues.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Analyze and visualize the data to gain insights and understand the relationships between features.

Feature selection: Choose the most relevant features based on EDA, domain knowledge, or statistical tests.

Feature scaling: Scale the features to a common range to avoid bias towards features with larger values.

Feature transformation: Transform the features using mathematical operations like logarithmic, exponential, or power functions to create new features or improve  their distribution.

Feature encoding: Encode categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding, or target encoding to convert them into numerical values.

Feature extraction: Extract features from unstructured data like text or images using techniques like bag-of-words, TF-IDF, or CNNs.

Feature generation: Create new features using combinations of existing features or external data sources to capture higher-level relationships.

Feature validation: Validate the selected features by testing the model's performance on a validation set or using cross-validation techniques.
